## Project: Online Library Management
Online Library Management includes a webpage that allows users to access library resources such as books, journals, and multimedia materials over the internet. The website allows users to quickly and conveniently search for, checkout, reserve and return books, articles, journals,...
This system also makes it simpler for the administrator to manage the users' accounts as well as keep track of books, articles, and journals,... 
Library management systems also include maintaining a database for entering new books and recording borrowed books with their due dates.
